# Real-World-Network-Architecture-and-Cyber-Security-Lab

## Objective

The Real World Network Architecture and CyberSecurity Lab aims to establish a controlled environment simulating and detecting cyber attacks, setup up and secure Routers, Switches using security best practices, User provisioning and deprovisioning, as well as other system administration responsibilities. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real world attack scenarios, perform system and network documentation. 

This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, Network architecture, attack patterns, and defensive strategies. 

### Skills Learned
- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficient in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity and networks.
- Proficient with cisco IOS to configure Routers and Switches

### Tools Used
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (Wireshark, Advanced IP Scanner) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Network Documentation (Packet Tracer)
- Firewall tool (Pfsense) for protecting the network.
- Cisco Router (csr1000v) for routing packets
- Windows 11 Ent Client for client machines
- Windows 2016 Core Server for issuing IP, dns and WINS configurations to client machines
- Windows 2016 GUI Server for managing the network (Router, Firewalls, and computers)

### Features
- VPN that is setup to be Point-to-Point.
- Active Directory Domain Service (Forest and Child Domain), Redundant Domain Controllers for Authentication, Authorization and Availability. 
- Pfsense Firewall and created Firewall Rules, blocking unnecessary ports.
- Routing rules Blocking specific Ip Addresses.
- Hyper-V Virtualization using Virtual Network Adapters to connect all Virtual Machines in this lab.
